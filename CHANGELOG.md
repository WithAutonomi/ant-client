# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ant` binary will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Default network binding changed from IPv4-only to IPv6 dual-stack. Hosts without a working IPv6 stack should pass `--ipv4-only` to avoid advertising unreachable v6 addresses to the DHT (which causes slow connects and junk address records).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Node management: `ant node add`, `ant node start`, `ant node stop`, `ant node status`, `ant node reset`
- Daemon management: `ant node daemon start`, `ant node daemon stop`, `ant node daemon status`
- Data operations: `ant file upload`, `ant file download`, `ant chunk put`, `ant chunk get`
- Wallet management: `ant wallet address`, `ant wallet balance`
- Automatic bootstrap peer loading from `bootstrap_peers.toml` config file
- `--json` global flag for structured output
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
