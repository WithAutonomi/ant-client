# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ant` binary will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Default network binding changed from IPv4-only to IPv6 dual-stack. Hosts without a working IPv6 stack should pass `--ipv4-only` to avoid advertising unreachable v6 addresses to the DHT (which causes slow connects and junk address records).
- `ant file upload` now writes datamaps as `<filename>.<extension>.datamap` instead of stripping the extension. Uploading `photo.jpg` produces `photo.jpg.datamap` (was `photo.datamap`). Existing datamaps remain readable.
- `ant file upload` no longer silently overwrites an existing datamap. Repeated uploads of the same source path produce `name-2.datamap`, `name-3.datamap`, … capped at 100 attempts. Pass `--overwrite` to restore the previous behaviour.

### Added
- `ant file upload --overwrite`: replace any existing `<filename>.datamap` rather than writing a suffixed sibling.
- `ant file download --datamap` no longer requires `-o/--output` — defaults to the original filename derived from the datamap basename (`photo.jpg.datamap` → `photo.jpg`, written to the current directory). Pass `-o` to override.
- `ant file download --datamap` now reads both msgpack (canonical) and legacy JSON datamaps, so datamaps produced by older versions of the GUI download cleanly via the CLI.

### Internal
- New `ant_core::datamap_file` module owns the on-disk datamap format (msgpack canonical, JSON legacy auto-detect on read) and naming convention. `ant-cli` and consumers like `ant-gui` route through this single helper instead of reimplementing serialization.
